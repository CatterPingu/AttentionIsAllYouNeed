# Transformer Implementation

This notebook provides an implementation of the Transformer model based on the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017). The purpose of this implementation is to gain a better understanding of transformers and their inner workings. The implementation is inspired by the tutorial available at [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/attention-is-all-you-need-discovering-the-transformer-paper-73e5ff5e0634).

Please note that this implementation has not been reproduced on my system due to various complexities of data paths. It serves as a learning exercise and reference for understanding the Transformer model.
